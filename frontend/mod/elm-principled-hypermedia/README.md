# Principled Hypermedia

Maybe too grand a name
or too grand an ideal.
The goal here is too support semantic API use,
as inspired by RDF, JSON-LD and Hydra.

`Hypermedia` allows arbitrary requests made at the "end" of
chains of requests, pulling the next link
from Hydra actions in each request.
Fundamentally, this is designed to support
"follow your nose" browsing of
HATEOS APIs.

`ResourceUpdate` is higher level wrappers to
facilitate manipulating specific REST resource.
